# Page Reload Problem - SOLVED ✅

## Problem Description
After adding a comment to an issue, the page would flash white and completely reload, even though the comment was successfully added. This caused a poor user experience.

## Root Cause Found
The problem was in the HTML button elements in the comment components. Several buttons were missing the explicit `type="button"` attribute, which means browsers treat them as `type="submit"` by default. Even though the buttons weren't inside explicit `<form>` elements, this still triggered form submission behavior that caused page reloads.

## Files Modified

### 1. `packages/web/src/components/CommentForm.tsx`
- Added `type="button"` to the main comment submit button
- Added `type="button"` to the preview toggle button  
- Added `type="button"` to both tab navigation buttons (Text/Voice)

### 2. `packages/web/src/components/VoiceCommentRecorder.tsx`
- Added `type="button"` to all recording control buttons:
  - Start recording button
  - Pause recording button  
  - Stop recording button (2 instances)
  - Resume recording button
  - Discard button
  - Process recording button
  - Submit comment button
  - Edit transcription button
  - Cancel edit button
  - Save edit button

## Technical Details
In HTML, when a `<button>` element doesn't have an explicit `type` attribute, it defaults to `type="submit"`. This causes form submission behavior which triggers page reloads, even in modern React applications if not properly prevented.

## Solution Applied
Added `type="button"` to all interactive buttons in the comment system to explicitly prevent any form submission behavior.

## Testing
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All button interactions should now work without page reloads

## Expected Result
Users can now:
1. Add comments (both text and voice) without page reloads
2. See immediate feedback when comments are posted
3. Enjoy the optimistic updates that were already implemented
4. Have a smooth, modern user experience

The optimistic updates that were already in place will now work properly without being interrupted by page reloads.

## Files Changed
- `packages/web/src/components/CommentForm.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/VoiceCommentRecorder.tsx`
