# SpecifAI — “Say it. Ship it.”
*One‑Tap Voice‑to‑Issue for faster product delivery*

## 1 · Problem
- Up to 50 % of dev budgets vanish in re‑work; 70–85 % due to unclear requirements.
- 37 % of projects fail because goals were ambiguous.
- Engineers lose 5–15 h/week clarifying specs.

## 2 · Spark
1 tap → voice note → AI drafts a GitHub Issue. Stakeholder taps “Yes”, ticket is live.  
Zero Jira ping‑pong, zero Slack archaeology.

## 3 · How It Works
1. React PWA mic recorder.  
2. Whisper v4 + GPT‑4o clarify loop.  
3. GitHub GraphQL sync.  
4. Supabase for auth, data, realtime.

## 4 · Impact
| Today (10 devs) | With SpecifAI |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 10 × 8 h × 46 wks lost | reclaim 15 % (≈ 1 440 h / €140 k) |

## 5 · Roadmap
MVP (Week 4) → Beta (Week 8) → GA (Week 12).

> SpecifAI closes the gap between business and code in a single tap.
